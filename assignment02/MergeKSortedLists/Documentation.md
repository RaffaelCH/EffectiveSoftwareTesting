## Task 1: Code Coverage
In this task, we applied structural testing, trying to reach 100% line coverage, which we achieved successfully.
All lines of code (LOC) are covered by the tests. 
We could have used fewer tests to reach 100% line coverage, but we wanted to test all possible cases, having a more robust test suite, not only trying to achieve a certain percentage.
We used the JaCoCo plugin to analyze and generate coverage reports.
The screenshots can be found in the ['Assets' folder](./Assets) as described in the assignment's instructions.
