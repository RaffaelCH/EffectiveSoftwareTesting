- injected the MessageService dependency into the MessageProcessor constructor for better testability.
- The unit tests use Mockito to mock the MessageService object.
- Test A verifies the number of invocations on the sendMessage method using times(2).
- Test B uses ArgumentCaptor to capture the arguments passed to sendMessage and asserts that they match the expected content from each message in the list.

#### Comparison of Techniques
##### Using ArgumentCaptor (B):

    - Advantages:
    It captures the actual arguments passed to the mock, making it easy to verify the values.
    Provides detailed insight into how the mock was interacted with.

    - Disadvantages:
    Slightly more complex setup and syntax.
    Can be less readable if there are many arguments or complex argument structures.

###### Increasing Observability (C):

    - Advantages:
    Simplifies the verification process by allowing direct assertions on the expected arguments.
    Encourages good design by promoting dependency injection.

    - Disadvantages:
    Requires refactoring of the class under test.
    May lead to additional boilerplate code for injecting dependencies.


    For this example, both approaches achieve the same goal. ArgumentCaptor is a common and effective solution when dealing with mocked methods. However, increasing observability by adding appropriate methods or logging can simplify tests in the long run and improve code maintainability.
