# Movie Streaming
## Use of Doubles for FileStreamService and CacheService
As the `FileStreamService` and `CacheService` interfaces are external dependencies, we need to create doubles for these services to test the `MovieStreamingManager` class.

## Mocking File System and Cache Interactions

## Handling of Failures


<!---
Use of Doubles for FileStreamService and CacheService
Identify external dependencies and implement tests using mocks to verify proper interactions.
Mocking File System and Cache Interactions
Test interactions with the mock file system and cache to ensure metadata and tokens are handled correctly.
Handling of Failures
Simulate file system downtimes and cache misses to test the system's resilience and error handling.
