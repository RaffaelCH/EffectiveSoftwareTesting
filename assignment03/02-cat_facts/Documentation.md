1. External Dependencies and Testing Strategy:

The project is dependent on the following external factors:

- HttpUtil Dependency: This class is responsible for making HTTP requests to the cat facts API. Since it interacts with an external service, we should use test doubles (mocks) to isolate the CatFactsRetriever class from the network and make the tests more deterministic.

- JSON Parsing Dependency: The CatFactsRetriever class uses the JSONObject and JSONArray classes from the org.json package to parse JSON responses. Since these are standard Java classes and don't involve external communication, we can use them directly without needing test doubles.

2. Refactoring for Testing Dependencies:
We can refactor the CatFactsRetriever class to make it easier to test by following these steps:
To facilitate testing, we can introduce an interface for the HttpUtil dependency and inject it into the CatFactsRetriever class via constructor injection. This allows us to easily substitute a mock implementation during testing.

3. Disadvantages of Using Test Doubles:
- Maintenance Overhead: Test doubles require maintenance, especially if the production code evolves. Changes in the real issmplementation might require corresponding updates in the test doubles.
- False Sense of Confidence: Mocked dependencies may not accurately represent the behavior of the real dependencies, leading to false positives or negatives in tests.
- Increased Complexity: Introducing mocks adds complexity to the test suite, making it harder to understand and maintain.
