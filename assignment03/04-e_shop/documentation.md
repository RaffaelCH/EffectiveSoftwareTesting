### Changes Made:
- Added lastProcessedOrder field to EmailNotificationService and InventoryManager to increase observability.
- Modified the onOrderPlaced method in both services to set lastProcessedOrder.
Added a getLastProcessedOrder method in both services to allow checking the last processed order.
- Updated EventPublisherTest to test both invocation counts and the content of invocations using ArgumentCaptor and increased observability.


### Advantages and Disadvantages:

##### Using ArgumentCaptor:

    - Advantages:
    Provides a detailed check of method arguments.
    Useful for complex argument validation.

    - Disadvantages:
    Can make tests more complex and less readable.


##### Increasing Observability:

    - Advantages:
        - Simplifies tests by allowing direct validation of state.
        - Encourages cleaner design and better encapsulation.
    - Disadvantages:
        - Requires modifying the code under test, which might not always be possible.
        - Could lead to additional code that is only useful for testing.

In this case, both approaches are viable. ArgumentCaptor is a common and effective solution for verifying arguments passed to methods. Increasing observability can improve code maintainability by making internal behavior more accessible for testing. You can choose the approach that best suits your specific needs and preferences.
